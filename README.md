Stereo Video Streaming in Cardboard Java.
=====================

This project is a fork of Matthew Wellings' "Stereo Video Streaming in Cardboard Java." repository which demonstrates the playback of video in Cardboard apps. The original repository can found under https://github.com/openforeveryone/CardboardStereoVideo

The app demonstrates the streaming of a Side-by-Side 3D video on a plane surface in front of the viewer.
